# VAE_MCMC
This repository presents a β-Variational Autoencoder (β-VAE) combined with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for inverse microstructure design and reconstruction. The workflow provides a physics-aware, probabilistic way to generate synthetic microstructures that meet user-defined feature constraints.
